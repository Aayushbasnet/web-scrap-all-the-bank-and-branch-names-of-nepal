# Web Scraping Bank and Branch Information using Node.js

## Overview

This Node.js script is designed to scrape bank and branch information from the [Financial Notices] website. It leverages Axios for making HTTP requests, Cheerio for parsing HTML, and ExcelJS for handling Excel files.

## Tech

Some of the tech and packages I have used are:

- [Node.js] - For the backend
- [Axios]   - Making HTTP requests!
- [Cheerio] - Awesome parsing HTML tool
- [ExcelJS] - Manipulating and handling excel file.

And of course this repo is open source with a [git-repo-url] on GitHub. So, feel free to contribute
